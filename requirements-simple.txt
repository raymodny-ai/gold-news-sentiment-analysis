# Note: Advanced ML models (torch, transformers, xgboost, tensorflow) are excluded
# to reduce installation complexity. The system will gracefully handle missing dependencies
# and only enable available features. Add them later for full functionality:
#
# pip install torch transformers xgboost tensorflow
#
# The system will automatically detect and enable advanced features when these are installed.
